An example UIM application might ingest plain text and identify entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or relations, such as works-for or located-at. &#13;&#10;UIMA enables such an application to be decomposed into components, for example &quot;language identification&quot; -&gt; &quot;language specific segmentation&quot; -&gt; &quot;sentence boundary detection&quot; -&gt; &quot;entity detection (person/place names etc.)&quot;. &#13;&#10;Each component must implement interfaces defined by the framework and must provide self-describing metadata via XML descriptor files. The framework manages these components and the data flow between them. Components are written in Java or C++; the data that flows between components is designed for efficient mapping between these languages. &#13;&#10;UIMA additionally provides capabilities to wrap components as network services, and can scale to very large volumes by replicating processing pipelines over a cluster of networked nodes.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Apache UIMA is an Apache-licensed open source implementation of the UIMA specification (that specification is, in turn, being developed concurrently by a technical committee within OASIS , a standards organization). &#13;&#10;We invite and encourage you to participate in both the implementation and specification efforts.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;UIMA is a component framework for analysing unstructured content such as text, audio and video. &#13;&#10;It comprises an SDK and tooling for composing and running analytic components written in Java and C++, with some support for Perl, Python and TCL. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Apache UIMA mailing lists:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Users - uima-user@incubator.apache.org&#13;&#10;Developers - uima-dev@incubator.apache.org&#13;&#10;Commits - uima-commits@incubator.apache.org&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Apache UIMA project committers:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Michael Baessler&#13;&#10;Edward Epstein&#13;&#10;Thilo Goetz&#13;&#10;Adam Lally&#13;&#10;Marshall Schor&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Apache UIMA project Mentors:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ken Coar (ASF member and Vice President)&#13;&#10;Sam Ruby (ASF member)"/><tcas:DocumentAnnotation xmi:id="8" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2441" language="x-unspecified"/><commons:DocumentMetadata xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" sourceUri="file:/home/pathfinder/Projects/BRATWorkspace/git/UIMA.Ext.Commons/data/inputDir/Apache_UIMA.txt" offsetInSource="0" documentSize="0" startProcessingTime="0"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="8 13"/></xmi:XMI>
